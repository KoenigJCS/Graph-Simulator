# This is Graph Simulator
## The Basics
This software serves as a visual display of two types of machine learning applied to the traveling salemsen problem
1. Hill Climbing Algorithm
2. Crossover PMX Genetic Algorithm
## How it works
The software has a set of csv files loaded into it with a variety of node aragements representing real life things like
1. The 53 largest cities in the United States
2. City blocks in Berlin
### The user can then enable one of the two alorithms to run on the note set to search for the most efficent path that goes to all cities once.
