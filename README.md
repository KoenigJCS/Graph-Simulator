## Summary
This is a visualization tool meant to make it easier to work on and implement algorithms for node based problems such as the TSP (traveling salesman problem) and the CVRP. There are a large number of predesigned nodal problems saved that can be loaded into the scene. Then an evaluation heuristic can be selected to attempt to “solve” the nodes in the visualiser, the user can modify the parameters and location of the nodes while they are in the visualizer to change the details of the simulation. Then as the evaluation runs in processes solutions are sent to be visualized and graphed for the user to see. See diagram below.
